For reference, the former defintion was \"role inhering in a material artifact that is designed to be a proper continuant part of some material artifact.\" 

Arguments for the changes include:
 
(a) replaced material artifact with \"material entity since portions of materials and discrete \"things\" found in nature can be components too. 

(b) Also replaced material artifact with material entity on the output side, or the \"thing\" that the component becomes a part of, since a component may become part of a \"system,\" and systems are not currently material artifacts as we envision, rather they are object aggregates. We may ultimately want to move systems under object, but that has its own issues. To be debated and figured out! 

(c) In industrial contexts, all components appear in some bill of material, be that some maintenance BOM, product BOM, engineering BOM, planning BOM, manufacturing BOM, or packaging BOM. The \"position\" the component appears at will surely be some level below the root level. We need to introduce BOM soon anyway, and once we do, we can refine the formalization here a bit.

(d) NOTE: We could leave Neil's 2019 proposed notion in the ontology as a super-class of the above, and perhaps rename this term/notion to \"product component role.\"

Other issues pending:

1. A component can be a raw material -- as in appear at the lowest level of some BOM. Once we define the architecture of BOMs, we need not forget to update our definition for raw material to reflect that it must exist at the \"leaf level\" of some BOM for some business entity.

2. Do we need to restrict the scope of component so it excludes agents and various types of object aggregates, like organizations? This is an ontological question.""" ;

Many agents, not necessarily those who are members of the manufacturing enterprise, may be playing a causal role in executing the processes of a manufacturing enterprise. E.g., the maintenance worker employeed by an outsourced maintenance service company who is on-premise fixing a broken machine belonging to the manufacturing enterprise. We can't really limit all agents to the manufacturing enterprise or members of it. What we can assert is that a manufacturing enterprise process achieves some objective that is \"carried\" (in BFO lingo) by the manufacturing entity. 

But how do we bound the scope of this? There are many processes performed by 3rd-party agents (logistics providers, suppliers, etc.), that while they directly achieve some objective carried by the enterprise with whom they have a contract, such agent types engage in many subprocesses of such dealing with logistics providers and down-stream suppliers, where there is no clear connection to how these other activities achieve contract terms they may have with some Manufacturing Enterprise (customer). 

2. Also, I'm not convinced this class belongs under the process branch of BFO. An enterprise process has parts any number of subprocesses which can be further decomposed into subprocesses to n levels. It is always the case that many of these are happing in parrallel (i.e., overlap on temporal regions) which would violate proper parthood rules for processes. Perhaps we move this class under Process Aggregate? Or, if we can leave it under Process, make it a defined class with no asserted subclasses, and just let the reasoners make the inferences as necessary.

(b) Removed restriction that an operation must be part of a product production process.

Realizing a process that (a) is not prescribed by some plan specification but rather mentally derived by a causative agent of type person, or verbally communicated and agreed to in the case of a person-aggregate type agent. , or (b) has a prescribed plan specification lacking sufficient details, or (c) is a process that has sub-processes, one or more of which lack a plan specification, or lack sufficient detail.  Such processes might still be considered planned processes -- meaning planned processes that perhaps are lacking in \"process maturity\" -- which often result in a wide degree of variability in achieving the desired outcomes. In many such processes, the causitive agent must rely on his/her/its experience, knowledge of best practices, etc., to form individual or collective intentions that are applied in realizing a process to the best of their abilities.

Part of this will be dependent on what definition we settle on for term plan specification. If we extend that definition to include ‘protocol-driven' plans, which include spoken or simply thought plans. In this case, complement scenario (a) above will be automatically included. If we proceed in this fasion, we should add a more general term above Plan Specification, perhaps \"Plan,\" that has subclasses plan specification, verbally-communicated plan, and mental plan.

3. Do we need to expand our notion of Agent? Right now, all planned processes involve some Agent as participant, and our notion of agent is limited to person or organization. Yet many planned processes require no agent to be present (as in a lights-out factory, production line, totally-automated assembly cell, or the use of smart/autonomous machine).

4. Also, Agent as currently defined, excludes person aggregates. This needs to be resolved since teams or crews may need to collectively bear a resource role in order to realize their dispositions in planned processes. And teams/person aggregates are not organizations."""@en ;

2. 'Planned’ is here functioning as a specifier, rather than as a modifier analogous to ‘cancelled’ or ‘averted’.

3. A planned process remains a planned process even after it has occurred.

3. Do we need to relabel this to something like 'Portion of Input Material to Manufacturing Process?\" It seems portions of matter could serve as inputs to many more processes than just manufacturing processes.

4. Why is this asserted directly under material entity? As we proceed in adding additional kinds of portions of solids, liquids and gases found in manufacturing we will create many sibling classes under material entity and that, I believe, will cloud the purpose of the BFO foundational classes. Alternative approaches: (a) Assert a grouping class under material entity, say a \"portion of material,” and put the various portions of xyz beneath it. Or (b) put all portions of xyz under object. After all, a rock, a portion of water, and even portions of gas and sub-atomic particles, all fit nicely under object. But then we come up with arguments on how they satisfy the causal unity criterion (see Barry's arguments for \"rock\" in the BFO 2.0 reference document). In offline discussions, Barry's recommendation is option (b), perhaps also with a grouping-level term such as \"portion of material.\"

5.

Each such process includes what we shall call a beat process profile instance as part, a subtype of rate process profile in which the salient ratio is not distance covered but rather number of beat cycles per unit of time.

Although the above holds true for the general use of roles, we choose here to insert \"intends to sell\" into the definition, allowing us to have an umbrella term that covers all phases a product's life cycle, including those before it physically exists or is available to be sold.

One argument against adding is that while a resource may be available to an agent to use or obtain, and may be in actual use or the agent has some planned use for it, there will be other cases where it is not in use nor does the agent have any plans to do so. Example: The gold in my vault is available to me but I have no planned use for it yet.

(a) A piece of equipment used by a machine or as stand-alone and can bear a Manufacturing Role.
(b) Are tools always movable? We believe the answer is a yes but invite our wider IOF audience to cite use cases where this is not the case.
(c) Other attributes:
- Some tools are consumed others are not. 
- Some are used by people, others by machines.
- Some tools are \"single-item\" or stand-alone (e.g., hammer) and others may be complex (e.g., Wi-Fi-connected digital torque wrench).
- Aren't fixtures tools as well? Yes, they are a subtype. See definition below for IOF Fixture, a top-20 term
- Most if not all tools have various interfaces (electronic, mechanical, etc.)""" ;
         iof:xUnresolvedIssues """1. Made some major revisions to align more with standard definitions. Will formalize if approved.

2. We might want to introduce various subclasses: Mechanical tools, hand tools, powered/machine-based hand tools, cutting tools (linear, rotary, hybrid), instrument, machine tools, etc.

3. Might want to introduce tool role and make this a defined class.""" ;

                     iof:xUnresolvedIssues """1. Eventually we may need to look into FMA ontology and how they handled orientations. Is change in orientation to be considered under this definition?

2. I think we should change the label to something else, perhaps \"material handling process\" or \"material movement process.\" The classical meaning of the verb \"to transport\" means \"to take or carry (people or goods) from one place to another by means of a vehicle, aircraft, or ship.\" Also, this term is too similar to the classical use of the terms to transport and of various transportation processes as used in the logistics industry. 

3. For the formal definition we have arrived at above, any process where you change the site of a material entity, would be a transport process -- even the picking up of a tool from the site of a tool box as part of the process of setting up a part in a fixture will be inferred as a transport process.""" ;
