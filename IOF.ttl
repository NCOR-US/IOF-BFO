For reference, the former defintion was \"role inhering in a material artifact that is designed to be a proper continuant part of some material artifact.\" 

Arguments for the changes include:
 
(a) replaced material artifact with \"material entity since portions of materials and discrete \"things\" found in nature can be components too. 

(b) Also replaced material artifact with material entity on the output side, or the \"thing\" that the component becomes a part of, since a component may become part of a \"system,\" and systems are not currently material artifacts as we envision, rather they are object aggregates. We may ultimately want to move systems under object, but that has its own issues. To be debated and figured out! 

(c) In industrial contexts, all components appear in some bill of material, be that some maintenance BOM, product BOM, engineering BOM, planning BOM, manufacturing BOM, or packaging BOM. The \"position\" the component appears at will surely be some level below the root level. We need to introduce BOM soon anyway, and once we do, we can refine the formalization here a bit.

(d) NOTE: We could leave Neil's 2019 proposed notion in the ontology as a super-class of the above, and perhaps rename this term/notion to \"product component role.\"

Other issues pending:

1. A component can be a raw material -- as in appear at the lowest level of some BOM. Once we define the architecture of BOMs, we need not forget to update our definition for raw material to reflect that it must exist at the \"leaf level\" of some BOM for some business entity.

2. Do we need to restrict the scope of component so it excludes agents and various types of object aggregates, like organizations? This is an ontological question.""" ;

E.g., the maintenance worker employeed by an outsourced maintenance service company who is on-premise fixing a broken machine belonging to the manufacturing enterprise. We can't really limit all agents to the manufacturing enterprise or members of it. What we can assert is that a manufacturing enterprise process achieves some objective that is \"carried\" (in BFO lingo) by the manufacturing entity. 

But how do we bound the scope of this? There are many processes performed by 3rd-party agents (logistics providers, suppliers, etc.), that while they directly achieve some objective carried by the enterprise with whom they have a contract, such agent types engage in many subprocesses of such dealing with logistics providers and down-stream suppliers, where there is no clear connection to how these other activities achieve contract terms they may have with some Manufacturing Enterprise (customer). 

2. Also, I'm not convinced this class belongs under the process branch of BFO. An enterprise process has parts any number of subprocesses which can be further decomposed into subprocesses to n levels. It is always the case that many of these are happing in parrallel (i.e., overlap on temporal regions) which would violate proper parthood rules for processes. Perhaps we move this class under Process Aggregate? Or, if we can leave it under Process, make it a defined class with no asserted subclasses, and just let the reasoners make the inferences as necessary.

Such processes might still be considered planned processes -- meaning planned processes that perhaps are lacking in \"process maturity\" -- which often result in a wide degree of variability in achieving the desired outcomes. In many such processes, the causitive agent must rely on his/her/its experience, knowledge of best practices, etc., to form individual or collective intentions that are applied in realizing a process to the best of their abilities.

Part of this will be dependent on what definition we settle on for term plan specification. If we extend that definition to include ‘protocol-driven' plans, which include spoken or simply thought plans. In this case, complement scenario (a) above will be automatically included. If we proceed in this fasion, we should add a more general term above Plan Specification, perhaps \"Plan,\" that has subclasses plan specification, verbally-communicated plan, and mental plan.

3. Do we need to expand our notion of Agent? Right now, all planned processes involve some Agent as participant, and our notion of agent is limited to person or organization. Yet many planned processes require no agent to be present (as in a lights-out factory, production line, totally-automated assembly cell, or the use of smart/autonomous machine).

2. Aren't the inputs to a manufacturing process specified in some directive ICE? As in e.g. a process specification, the work instructions, a BOM (picklist), etc.? To be discussed.

3. If we are to introduce a class like this, why not then introduce simply \"Input Material (defined class) =def. Material Entity and bears Input Material Role?\" This will be come useful in definiing Manufacturing Process (see its definition).

4. Why is this asserted under material entity? More generally, this issue concerns portions of solids, liquids and gases – perhaps man-made but also as found in nature. As we proceed in adding additional terms to the core IOF ontology to handle various types of portions of solids, liquids and gases – all portions of matter – we will create many sibling classes to object aggregate, object, and fiat object part. That clouds the purpose of these BFO classes. We should only introduce sibling classes here for good reasons. Alternative approaches? Option (a) would be to assert a grouping class under material entity, say “a portion of material,” and put the various portions of xyz beneath it. But in fact, a portion of material and material entity are synonymous. So this would not solve our problem. Alternatively, option (b) would be to put all portions of xyz under object, after all, a rock, a portion of water, and even a portion of gas andd portion of sub-atomic particles, all fit nicely under object and we can come up with arguments on how they satisfy the rules in effect for object, such as satisfying its causal unity criterion (see Barry's arguments for \"rock\" in the BFO 2.0 reference document).

Note that in CCO, they have \"portion of material\" asserted under \"portion of processed material,\" which is asserted under \"material artifact.\" But certainly portions of input materials to a manufacturing process may ones found in nature (as in water to enable a chemical reaction).

On a somewhat higher level of complexity are what we shall call rate process profiles, which are the targets of selective abstraction focused not on determinate quality magnitudes plotted over time, but rather on certain ratios between these magnitudes and elapsed times. A speed process profile, for example, is represented by a graph plotting against time the ratio of distance covered per unit of time. Since rates may change, and since such changes, too, may have rates of change, we have to deal here with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive levels

2. One important sub-family of rate process profiles is illustrated by the beat or frequency profiles of cyclical processes, illustrated by the 60 beats per minute beating process of John’s heart, or the 120 beats per minute drumming process involved in one of John’s performances in a rock band, and so on. Each such process includes what we shall call a beat process profile instance as part, a subtype of rate process profile in which the salient ratio is not distance covered but rather number of beat cycles per unit of time. Each beat process profile instance instantiates the determinable universal beat process profile. But it also instantiates multiple more specialized universals at lower levels of generality, selected from   rate process profilebeat process profileregular beat process profile3 bpm beat process profile4 bpm beat process profileirregular beat process profileincreasing beat process profileand so on.In the case of a regular beat process profile, a rate can be assigned in the simplest possible fashion by dividing the number of cycles by the length of the temporal region occupied by the beating process profile as a whole. Irregular process profiles of this sort, for example as identified in the clinic, or in the readings on an aircraft instrument panel, are often of diagnostic significance.

3. The simplest type of process profiles are what we shall call ‘quality process profiles’, which are the process profiles which serve as the foci of the sort of selective abstraction that is involved when measurements are made of changes in single qualities, as illustrated, for example, by process profiles of mass, temperature, aortic pressure, and so on.""" ;

The BFO term ‘role’ is used extensively in this formalization to do justice to those cases where general terms are ​phase sortals,​ which means they hold only for certain phases in the existence of the relevant entities. Thus, for example, a given material entity may be correctly describable as a ​prototype at one phase in its existence and as a ​product​ in a later phase.

Although the above holds true for the general use of roles, we choose here to insert \"intends to sell\" into the definition, allowing us to have an umbrella term that covers all phases a product's life cycle, including those before it physically exists or is available to be sold. This would suggest we might introduce subclasses such as \"product-in-design role,\" \"prototype product role,\" etc., as the ontology evolves.
 
2. Once a continuant bears the product role, it continues to do so for the life of the product -- that is until such time that it is the output of some \"end of life\" process. 

Note, the end of life process in some cases might be when the Agent who sells ceases to support it. Agent here includes successor Agent-owners. In other cases, the end of life may be when the last instance of a product type is recycled.

In this definition, we wanted to add relation \"provides benefit to\" or even “realizes a function” as found in the common definitions, but chose not to. One argument against adding is that while a resource may be available to an agent to use or obtain, and may be in actual use or the agent has some planned use for it, there will be other cases where it is not in use nor does the agent have any plans to do so. Example: The gold in my vault is available to me but I have no planned use for it yet.

2. Yet with this new definition, it apperas we might have problems with relation “is available to.” Namely, something available to an agent to do something with that has not yet been determined, opens to door up to how we deal with “possibilities” in FOL and OWL. Perhaps the work-around is to say available-to means an agent has access to or control over some thing, to be potentially used, or has some active intention to use, or is currently using it.

For example, three instances of information bearers -- such as a bar chart, color-coded map, and a written report -- each of which lists the GDP of Countries for the year 2010 are each different bearers of the same information content. It is this content that is generically dependent upon its bearer. This treatment of Informational Content Entity (cf. the Information Artifact Ontology) leads to a principle of subtyping based upon the relationship that ICE's have with the Entity they are about rather than characteristics such as format, language, measurement scale, or media. The latter are treated here as being Qualities of bearers." ;
