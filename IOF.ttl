2. This definition does not attempt to capture “task-based” capabilities an entity may bear -- e.g., a stone’s capability to kill when used by some person. Rather, it captures “proper capabilities.” See related discussion of “proper functions” in the literature. 

3. Some but not all functions are capabilities. Capabilities are often added to an artifact by the designer/engineer, or to a biological entity by evolution or nature, as “additional benefits,” and are differentiated from function or purpose. E.g. the air conditioner in your car is a capability but not the function of your car. The ability of your heart to beat fast to support your need to run fast to escape a threat.”

4. An organism’s interest in the capability of an entity may be direct, indirect, or it may even be unaware of any interest/benefit. E.g., this titanium drill-bit’s capability to mill/drill hardened materials may be of direct interest to some process designer searching for a suitable tool to do material removal, yet of fairly indirect interest to the tool bit’s original designer.  The leadership skills of an organization’s management may be of direct interest to the executive team, yet of little interest to a rank-and-file staff member. Furthermore, an organism may benefit from an entity’s capability without even being aware of it. E.g., rank-and-file staff members may not care or know about the benefits he/she derives from the leadership skills of his manager.""" ;

(b) We want to be explicit about 'engaging in' some manufacturing process, versus just 'participating in' it, since otherwise we have counter examples where resellers, transportation and logitics companies, distributors, and other 3rd-party agents, that only 'participate in' the production process, will be inferred as manufacturing enterprises. And (c) we needed to eliminate the circularity Neil had introduced in term Manufacturing Enterprise Process, which is defined as \"a process that has agent, some manufacturing enterprise.\"

Many agents, not necessarily those who are members of the manufacturing enterprise, may be playing a causal role in executing the processes of a manufacturing enterprise. E.g., the maintenance worker employeed by an outsourced maintenance service company who is on-premise fixing a broken machine belonging to the manufacturing enterprise. We can't really limit all agents to the manufacturing enterprise or members of it. What we can assert is that a manufacturing enterprise process achieves some objective that is \"carried\" (in BFO lingo) by the manufacturing entity. 

But how do we bound the scope of this? There are many processes performed by 3rd-party agents (logistics providers, suppliers, etc.), that while they directly achieve some objective carried by the enterprise with whom they have a contract, such agent types engage in many subprocesses of such dealing with logistics providers and down-stream suppliers, where there is no clear connection to how these other activities achieve contract terms they may have with some Manufacturing Enterprise (customer). 

2. Also, I'm not convinced this class belongs under the process branch of BFO. An enterprise process has parts any number of subprocesses which can be further decomposed into subprocesses to n levels. It is always the case that many of these are happing in parrallel (i.e., overlap on temporal regions) which would violate proper parthood rules for processes. Perhaps we move this class under Process Aggregate? Or, if we can leave it under Process, make it a defined class with no asserted subclasses, and just let the reasoners make the inferences as necessary.

A similar argument we will have when introducing product lifecycle process (or process aggregate).""" ;

2.

Changes include:

(a) Generalized to allow operations to have any number of subclasses in sub-domains (maintenance operation, assembly operation, material handling operation, receiving operation, etc.)

(b) Removed restriction that an operation must be part of a product production process. If we need a subclass to capture the type of operations that only \"consume\" or \"modify\" input materials to produce semi-finished material entities or manufactured products as output, then we can do so. Or better yet, the PPS working group can do so in their ontology module.

(c) Added restriction that requires participation of some Resource via the \"realizes some resource role\" clause. 

(d) Added restriction that an operation must occur in a single spatial region.

(e) Planned processes (inspection, test, material change, material modification, material move, etc.) can be realized as part of a manufaturing process, or in other contexts, hence, we make manufacturing operation a defined class, under which any of these can be inferred, when they are part of a manufacturing process.

3. Testing.

Such processes might still be considered planned processes -- meaning planned processes that perhaps are lacking in \"process maturity\" -- which often result in a wide degree of variability in achieving the desired outcomes. In many such processes, the causitive agent must rely on his/her/its experience, knowledge of best practices, etc., to form individual or collective intentions that are applied in realizing a process to the best of their abilities.

Part of this will be dependent on what definition we settle on for term plan specification. If we extend that definition to include ‘protocol-driven' plans, which include spoken or simply thought plans. In this case, complement scenario (a) above will be automatically included. If we proceed in this fasion, we should add a more general term above Plan Specification, perhaps \"Plan,\" that has subclasses plan specification, verbally-communicated plan, and mental plan.

3. Do we need to expand our notion of Agent? Right now, all planned processes involve some Agent as participant, and our notion of agent is limited to person or organization. Yet many planned processes require no agent to be present (as in a lights-out factory, production line, totally-automated assembly cell, or the use of smart/autonomous machine).

On a somewhat higher level of complexity are what we shall call rate process profiles, which are the targets of selective abstraction focused not on determinate quality magnitudes plotted over time, but rather on certain ratios between these magnitudes and elapsed times. A speed process profile, for example, is represented by a graph plotting against time the ratio of distance covered per unit of time. Since rates may change, and since such changes, too, may have rates of change, we have to deal here with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive levels

2. One important sub-family of rate process profiles is illustrated by the beat or frequency profiles of cyclical processes, illustrated by the 60 beats per minute beating process of John’s heart, or the 120 beats per minute drumming process involved in one of John’s performances in a rock band, and so on. Each such process includes what we shall call a beat process profile instance as part, a subtype of rate process profile in which the salient ratio is not distance covered but rather number of beat cycles per unit of time. Each beat process profile instance instantiates the determinable universal beat process profile.

Irregular process profiles of this sort, for example as identified in the clinic, or in the readings on an aircraft instrument panel, are often of diagnostic significance.

3. The simplest type of process profiles are what we shall call ‘quality process profiles’, which are the process profiles which serve as the foci of the sort of selective abstraction that is involved when measurements are made of changes in single qualities, as illustrated, for example, by process profiles of mass, temperature, aortic pressure, and so on.""" ;

The BFO term ‘role’ is used extensively in this formalization to do justice to those cases where general terms are ​phase sortals,​ which means they hold only for certain phases in the existence of the relevant entities. Thus, for example, a given material entity may be correctly describable as a ​prototype at one phase in its existence and as a ​product​ in a later phase.

Although the above holds true for the general use of roles, we choose here to insert \"intends to sell\" into the definition, allowing us to have an umbrella term that covers all phases a product's life cycle, including those before it physically exists or is available to be sold. This would suggest we might introduce subclasses such as \"product-in-design role,\" \"prototype product role,\" etc., as the ontology evolves.
 
2. Once a continuant bears the product role, it continues to do so for the life of the product -- that is until such time that it is the output of some \"end of life\" process. 

Note, the end of life process in some cases might be when the Agent who sells ceases to support it. Agent here includes successor Agent-owners. In other cases, the end of life may be when the last instance of a product type is recycled.

(c) [defined period of time] is a narrow field of time, or a particular point in time, by which an objective or task must be accomplished.
(d) [A task can be part of] a chronological sequence of events, also referred to as a chronology, schedule or timetable.

2. [BPMN/OMG.org]: A task represents a single unit of work that is not or cannot be broken down to a further level of business process detail. It is referred to as an atomic activity. A task is the lowest level activity illustrated on a process diagram. A set of tasks may represent a high-level procedure.

3. [APICS]: (a) In project management, the lowest level to which work can be subdivided on a project. (b) In activity-based cost accounting, a task, a subdivision of an activity, is the least amount of work. Tasks are used to describe activities.

2. [wikipedia] A tool is an object used to extend the ability of an individual to modify features of the surrounding environment. Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools. The set of tools required to perform different tasks that are part of the same activity is called gear or equipment.

2. [dictionary] A tool is a device or implement, especially one held in the hand, used to carry out a particular function.

3. [From prior IOF Discussions]: 
(a) A piece of equipment used by a machine or as stand-alone and can bear a Manufacturing Role.
(b) Are tools always movable? We believe the answer is a yes but invite our wider IOF audience to cite use cases where this is not the case.
(c) Other attributes:
- Some tools are consumed others are not. 
- Some are used by people, others by machines.
- Some tools are \"single-item\" or stand-alone (e.g., hammer) and others may be complex (e.g., Wi-Fi-connected digital torque wrench).
- Aren't fixtures tools as well? Yes, they are a subtype. See definition below for IOF Fixture, a top-20 term

3.
