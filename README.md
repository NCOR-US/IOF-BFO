# IOF-BFO
A repository for files developed for the Industrial Ontology Foundry. 

WARNING: This file is under active development and may change radically in the next few months. It is posted here in order to be accessible to the IOF community as it undergoes development. 

This repository contains:
1. An owl implementation of the IOF's top terms ontology, serialized in Turtle
2. A folder of two BFO artifacts that are imported by this ontology.
3. A folder containing images of the class hierarchy.
4. A SPARQL querying for extracting the classes and their annotations.
