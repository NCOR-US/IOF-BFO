        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1.    Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus</skos:definition>

        <rdfs:comment>1. Prescribes is a primitive relation. A prescribes B means: A is some information content entity that tells us how the world has to be for it to conform to A. For example, a command prescribes how you should behave in order to conform to the command. A quality specification prescribes how a product has to be in order to conform to the quality specification.

2. Prescribes can be understood in terms of Searle’s idea of a mind to world direction of fit – where prescribing occurs there is a portion of reality that involves something like an attempt by an agent to make the world fit what the agent intends. World to mind direction of fit occurs where a mind tries to make itself fit – for example, in its assertions or beliefs – the world [19].</rdfs:comment>

2. A person or thing that takes an active role or produces a specified effect.

3. In computing: intelligent, artificial, mobile, &amp; autonomous</xExampleComplement>
        <xUnresolvedIssues>1. We may want to add the condition that to be an Agent, either (a) there must exist at some time an intention the Agent bears, or (b) there must exist some action in which the Agent played a causal role (which would imply the existance of some intention).

2. What about chemical agents that play a causitive role in planned processes? Certainly these don&apos;t have intentions but they do play a causative role in the processes they participate in (e.g., platinum is an agent in the reduction reactions that help eliminate various pollutants in car exhausts).

3. We may want to expand the definition to include other types of non-human agents, like smart systems (robots, smart cars, etc.), which more-or-less, either have &quot;programmed intentions&quot; or &quot;learned intentions&quot; -- so not far off from what humans can do, in particular contexts. See other types under counter examples.</xUnresolvedIssues>
        <rdfs:comment>1. Every agent bears some intention at some time.

2. Agent is not a role term in the BFO sense. This implies also that it is not a phase sortal.

3. When an organization is an agent, this is because one or more of the persons who are members of the organization realize its intentions.</rdfs:comment>

        <xUnresolvedIssues>This updated definition tries to address many of the issues raised last year (see master working document of IOF terms). Major changes: moved term under material artifact. Dropped class/subclass subassembly and completed assembly. Aligned definition to model it after the one found in businessdictionary.com (see above).

Unresolved issue (for this and many other terms):

2. Need a way to represent work-in-progress or WIP material entities and artifacts. Some of these are not yet components (as they don&apos;t show up on some bill of material), while others are (phantom components). 

3. Related terms to be created:

disassembly capability =def. a capability, that if realized, is realized in some act of disassembly

act of disassembly =def. planned process prescribed by some plan specification (disassembly instructions) wherein an input assembly containing one or more components as parts is taken apart to create outputs: the assembly and one ore more components as separated material artifacts, and which realizes some disassembly capability of the assembly and components.

Obviously need to formalize what it means to not damage a material artifact/entity, and to not destroy one.</xUnresolvedIssues>

Axiom: Capabilities are such that their realizations can be graded on a scale according to some normative range, which if realized within the normative range, will have satisfied “an interest” of some organism.

More general than function, but not the &quot;reason&quot; for the bearer&apos;s exist.
Turn functions into capabilities (the capability of drill bit gives its host, drilling press, the function to do drilling activities).

Capabilities &quot;bring benefit&quot; to some agent -- is broadly true but nobody liked it...so they went to relation &quot;has interest in.&quot;

        <xExampleCounter>Most if not all functions measured according to some scale will be inferred as capabilities. We can readily argue that the purpose or function of most entities found in nature will &quot;be of interest&quot; to some organism.  Likewise, any function of an artifact designed by man will be of interest to some person or organization. But is this a bad outcome?</xExampleCounter>
        <xUnresolvedIssues xml:lang="en">1. The term “organism” needs to be introduced or we might replace it with “intentional agent.” We can grab a suitable definition from CCO or OBI for organism, but the latter term has not been defined yet. Organism might have subclasses “Person,” and “Animal” (non-exhaustive).

2. Relation “has an interest in” needs to be introduced. Our prior definition had “provides benefit to some agent.” 

3. We might soon be introducing subclasses of capability such as “biological capability,” “designed/engineered capability,” “skill” and perhaps “learned capability” (for non-human agents/entities). How quickly we introduce these into the IOF core depends on WG use cases and shared notions surfacing from them.</xUnresolvedIssues>
        <rdfs:comment>1. The BFO term ‘disposition’ is used to refer to all tendencies, powers, habits, skills, potentials, and so forth, which a material entity may possess. Dispositions, like BFO:realizables, are realized in processes.

2. This definition does not attempt to capture “task-based” capabilities an entity may bear -- e.g., a stone’s capability to kill when used by some person. Rather, it captures “proper capabilities.” See related discussion of “proper functions” in the literature. 

3. Some but not all functions are capabilities. Capabilities are often added to an artifact by the designer/engineer, or to a biological entity by evolution or nature, as “additional benefits,” and are differentiated from function or purpose. E.g. the air conditioner in your car is a capability but not the function of your car. The ability of your heart to beat fast to support your need to run fast to escape a threat.”

4. An organism’s interest in the capability of an entity may be direct, indirect, or it may even be unaware of any interest/benefit. E.g., this titanium drill-bit’s capability to mill/drill hardened materials may be of direct interest to some process designer searching for a suitable tool to do material removal, yet of fairly indirect interest to the tool bit’s original designer.  The leadership skills of an organization’s management may be of direct interest to the executive team, yet of little interest to a rank-and-file staff member. Furthermore, an organism may benefit from an entity’s capability without even being aware of it. E.g., rank-and-file staff members may not care or know about the benefits he/she derives from the leadership skills of his manager.</rdfs:comment>

        <xUnresolvedIssues>Changes made to the 2019 definition (and reflected above):
 
1. Components in manufacturing are not necessarily self-standing products. Some components are never sold. I struck this comment.

2. Asserted this under material entity vs material artifact. There are components of in discrete products and as part of &quot;recipes&quot; in batch processes (as in batch chemical, cosmetics, plastics, etc.) in which the &quot;component ingredients&quot; are in fact not man-made. Basic example is &quot;water&quot; which is mixed in with other raw material components, to produce the product or some intermediate-level processed material. Similar examples are found in the continuous process industries. Of course the argument can be made that all raw materials, as they arrive at the factory, are processed materials. To be discussed further and then decided. Then of course we have Hyunmin&apos;s counter example: The sea shells my daughter collects on the beach to be packaged in her garage and listed/sold to customers on the Amazon online marketplace as product;-)

Other proposed changes:

1. Component is a synonym for part and enters the realm of parthood and philosophical discussions. To avoid this, we should rename it, perhaps to Product Component.</xUnresolvedIssues>

        <xUnresolvedIssues>The above revised definition aligns more with the standard meaning in manufacturing for term component. For reference, the former defintion was &quot;role inhering in a material artifact that is designed to be a proper continuant part of some material artifact.&quot; 

Arguments for the changes include:
 
(a) replaced material artifact with &quot;material entity since portions of materials and discrete &quot;things&quot; found in nature can be components too. 

(b) Also replaced material artifact with material entity on the output side, or the &quot;thing&quot; that the component becomes a part of, since a component may become part of a &quot;system,&quot; and systems are not currently material artifacts as we envision, rather they are object aggregates. We may ultimately want to move systems under object, but that has its own issues. To be debated and figured out! 

(c) In industrial contexts, all components appear in some bill of material, be that some maintenance BOM, product BOM, engineering BOM, planning BOM, manufacturing BOM, or packaging BOM. The &quot;position&quot; the component appears at will surely be some level below the root level. We need to introduce BOM soon anyway, and once we do, we can refine the formalization here a bit.

(d) NOTE: We could leave Neil&apos;s 2019 proposed notion in the ontology as a super-class of the above, and perhaps rename this term/notion to &quot;product component role.&quot;

Other issues pending:

1. A component can be a raw material -- as in appear at the lowest level of some BOM. Once we define the architecture of BOMs, we need not forget to update our definition for raw material to reflect that it must exist at the &quot;leaf level&quot; of some BOM for some business entity.

2. Do we need to restrict the scope of component so it excludes agents and various types of object aggregates, like organizations? This is an ontological question.</xUnresolvedIssues>

        <rdfs:comment>1. If the agent of an intention is an organization (for example a business entity, a department, a team), then the organizational agent&apos;s intention will be the collective plans (some of which may be shared &amp; others not or at the individual level) of the corresponding person or members of the organization realizing the intention. Where persons of different levels of authority are involved, the subplans will be correspondingly nested. ​FIND LITERATURE ON THIS.

        <xUnresolvedIssues>1. Notice the changes from Neil&apos;s original definition: &quot;manufacturing enterprise =def. business entity whose function is to engage in manufacturing enterprise processes.&quot; 

Main arguments for the changes are: (a) We want more alignment to the SME definition (i.e., it is a business entity established to produce goods for sale -- as in manufactured products). (b) We want to be explicit about &apos;engaging in&apos; some manufacturing process, versus just &apos;participating in&apos; it, since otherwise we have counter examples where resellers, transportation and logitics companies, distributors, and other 3rd-party agents, that only &apos;participate in&apos; the production process, will be inferred as manufacturing enterprises. And (c) we needed to eliminate the circularity Neil had introduced in term Manufacturing Enterprise Process, which is defined as &quot;a process that has agent, some manufacturing enterprise.&quot;

        <iof-av:semi-formalNaturalLanguageDefinition>Manufacturing Enterprise Process =def. a Business Process that has Agent, some Manufacturing Enterprise that achieves some Objective carried the Manufacturing Enterprise.</iof-av:semi-formalNaturalLanguageDefinition>
        <xUnresolvedIssues>1. Made a few changes to the definition from what was previously proposed. Many agents, not necessarily those who are members of the manufacturing enterprise, may be playing a causal role in executing the processes of a manufacturing enterprise. E.g., the maintenance worker employeed by an outsourced maintenance service company who is on-premise fixing a broken machine belonging to the manufacturing enterprise. We can&apos;t really limit all agents to the manufacturing enterprise or members of it. What we can assert is that a manufacturing enterprise process achieves some objective that is &quot;carried&quot; (in BFO lingo) by the manufacturing entity. 

But how do we bound the scope of this? There are many processes performed by 3rd-party agents (logistics providers, suppliers, etc.), that while they directly achieve some objective carried by the enterprise with whom they have a contract, such agent types engage in many subprocesses of such dealing with logistics providers and down-stream suppliers, where there is no clear connection to how these other activities achieve contract terms they may have with some Manufacturing Enterprise (customer). 

2. Also, I&apos;m not convinced this class belongs under the process branch of BFO. An enterprise process has parts any number of subprocesses which can be further decomposed into subprocesses to n levels. It is always the case that many of these are happing in parrallel (i.e., overlap on temporal regions) which would violate proper parthood rules for processes. Perhaps we move this class under Process Aggregate? Or, if we can leave it under Process, make it a defined class with no asserted subclasses, and just let the reasoners make the inferences as necessary.

A similar argument we will have when introducing product lifecycle process (or process aggregate).</xUnresolvedIssues>
        <rdfs:comment>A manufacturing enterprise process includes as parts many planned processes  that achieve some objective of the manufacturing enterprise. The agents participating in these planned processes are typically members of the enterprise (permanent and temporary employees) but may also inlcude contractors and 3rd-parties working or operating under some agreement with the enterprise. Such planned processes include all the activities needed to run the enterprise, for example not just manufacturing processes, but support processes happening in the executive office, the &quot;back-offices&quot; and the front-offices, as well as enterprise resource planning, product design and engineering, manufacturing engineering, and the other &quot;manufacturing operations management&quot; support processes happening within the four walls of the factory.</rdfs:comment>

[APICS]</xDefinitionOtherCommon>
        <xUnresolvedIssues>1. The label is quite polysemous and means different things in different domains. Renamed the term to manufacturing operation.

2. The above definition has been generalized from what we had in December (&quot;planned process that is part of a product production process and is prescribed by an operation specification) to reflect more closely what this notion means in manufactuirng operations (see other common definitions above). Changes include:

(a) Generalized to allow operations to have any number of subclasses in sub-domains (maintenance operation, assembly operation, material handling operation, receiving operation, etc.)

(b) Removed restriction that an operation must be part of a product production process. If we need a subclass to capture the type of operations that only &quot;consume&quot; or &quot;modify&quot; input materials to produce semi-finished material entities or manufactured products as output, then we can do so. Or better yet, the PPS working group can do so in their ontology module.

(c) Added restriction that requires participation of some Resource via the &quot;realizes some resource role&quot; clause. 

(d) Added restriction that an operation must occur in a single spatial region.

(e) Planned processes (inspection, test, material change, material modification, material move, etc.) can be realized as part of a manufaturing process, or in other contexts, hence, we make manufacturing operation a defined class, under which any of these can be inferred, when they are part of a manufacturing process.

3. We should probably introduce term location and replace site.

4. Need to introduce new planned processes &quot;material change process&quot; and &quot;material modification process.&quot;</xUnresolvedIssues>

        <skos:example>1. Drilling operation: A specification to drill a single hole in a workpiece using a machine (drill press). Drilling three holes as part of a single operation.

2. Manual sawing operation: A specification to cut off part of a workpiece. In this case, the worker is using a handheld power saw to accomplish the operation. 

3. Testing. Although testing does not usually consume or modify a workpiece or portion of output material (unless it is an act of destructive testing or some act of drawing a sample to be consumed in a test), it does have as participant the manufactured product, or any input material is intended to or already is a part of the manufactured product.  

4. Setup or teardown of a machine in before/after the actual machining operation.
 
5. Moving a workpiece to the location or site where an operation is to take place. Moving a raw material or component item from stock to staging locations on the shop floor.

6. The disassembly or repair (other types of planned processes) of a manufactured product, or a component intended to be part of one, may or may not be inferred as a manufacturing operation depending on whether an instance of it appears as part of some manufacturing process. On the other hand, an instance of the same assembly, disasembly, or repair operation (e.g., of my Dell laptop at home by an authorized repair agent of Dell&apos;s), would likely be need to be inferred as part of an on-site repair process, or of a planned maintenance work order for some machine that a customer buys and has placed into service in their factory.</skos:example>

        <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Manufacturing Operation Specification</rdfs:label>
        <skos:example>1. Drilling operation: A specification to drill a hole in a workpiece using a machine (drill press). 

2. Sawing operation: A specification to cut off part of a workpiece. In this case, we are just using a tool (as opposed to a machine) as the resource to accomplish the operation. If I’m drilling three holes as part of a single operation, those actions/action specifications, become three steps of the operation.

3. A setup operation, a tear-down operation, an inspection operation, a test operation, a material handling operation (decomposed into a pick-up step, a move step, and a drop-off step).

4. An operating procedure for answering and routing calls to an organization&apos;s central phone number.</skos:example>

        <xDefinitionOtherCommon>1. The series of operations performed upon material to convert it from the raw material or a semifinished state to a state of further completion. Manufacturing processes can be arranged in a process layout, product layout, cellular layout, or fixed-position layout.

(a) (i) A &quot;manufacturing process&quot; is the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product.
(a) (ii) A &quot;manufacturing process&quot; [is a process in which] raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.

        <rdfs:comment>1. This definition presupposes that the outputs of a manufacturing process are in every case material entities. Processes analogous to manufacturing with digital outputs such as pieces of software will be treated at a later stage.

And these aspects are already captured in the definition for term quality. (b) What&apos;s the value in creating a subclass of quality for measurable qualities? Every quality perceived by mankind can be theoretically measured qualitatively or quantitatively, if we put our minds to it. 

Now if the intent was to capture some of the other aspects from ISO&apos;s definition, then perhaps we can open the debate again on the notion of feature vs quality in general, or between distinquishing features and other features, or between qualities that are inherent vs assigned, or those that are qualitative or quantitative, or those that are sensory vs behavioral, vs temporal, vs ergonomic;-)</xUnresolvedIssues>

More generally, any action where the causitive agent intends to adhere to laws and rules, may be improperly inferred as planned processes.</xExampleCounter>
        <xUnresolvedIssues xml:lang="en">1. We probably should figure out a way to formalize the definition so it includes the three complement scenarios above, (a), (b) and (c). Realizing a process that (a) is not prescribed by some plan specification but rather mentally derived by a causative agent of type person, or verbally communicated and agreed to in the case of a person-aggregate type agent. , or (b) has a prescribed plan specification lacking sufficient details, or (c) is a process that has sub-processes, one or more of which lack a plan specification, or lack sufficient detail.  Such processes might still be considered planned processes -- meaning planned processes that perhaps are lacking in &quot;process maturity&quot; -- which often result in a wide degree of variability in achieving the desired outcomes. In many such processes, the causitive agent must rely on his/her/its experience, knowledge of best practices, etc., to form individual or collective intentions that are applied in realizing a process to the best of their abilities.

Part of this will be dependent on what definition we settle on for term plan specification. If we extend that definition to include ‘protocol-driven&apos; plans, which include spoken or simply thought plans. In this case, complement scenario (a) above will be automatically included. If we proceed in this fasion, we should add a more general term above Plan Specification, perhaps &quot;Plan,&quot; that has subclasses plan specification, verbally-communicated plan, and mental plan.

3. Do we need to expand our notion of Agent? Right now, all planned processes involve some Agent as participant, and our notion of agent is limited to person or organization. Yet many planned processes require no agent to be present (as in a lights-out factory, production line, totally-automated assembly cell, or the use of smart/autonomous machine).

4. Also, Agent as currently defined, excludes person aggregates. This needs to be resolved since teams or crews may need to collectively bear a resource role in order to realize their dispositions in planned processes. And teams/person aggregates are not organizations.</xUnresolvedIssues>
        <rdfs:comment>1. This definition implies that every planned process is an action (though not vice versa). 
				  
2. &apos;Planned’ is here functioning as a specifier, rather than as a modifier analogous to ‘cancelled’ or ‘averted’. Therefore, to say that an action is planned is not to say that it has not yet taken place; rather, it is to say that it is (was or will have been) protocol-driven, instruction-driven, command-driven, or software-driven, or in some combination thereof, as prescribed by one or more information content entities. 
				  
3. A planned process remains a planned process even after it has occurred. Hence, the contrast is with accidental processes or with processes that did not turn out as planned (for example because a drill bit broke while realizing a planned drilling process), or with incidental processes not part of the realization of a plan (such as the lathe operator smoking a cigarette while operating her lathe).
				  
4. ‘Planned’ means ‘protocol driven’. Protocols may be written, spoken, or simply thought – as when upon waking up, we plan, for instance, what to eat for breakfast.</rdfs:comment>

        <xUnresolvedIssues>1. We&apos;ve previously had the counter examples above but I don&apos;t believe they are valid since none of them are inputs to a manufacturing process. Rather, they participate in manufacturing processes via the Used-in or are Agent-in relations.

2. Aren&apos;t the inputs to a manufacturing process specified in some directive ICE? As in e.g. a process specification, the work instructions, a BOM (picklist), etc.? To be discussed.

3. Do we need to relabel this to something like &apos;Portion of Input Material to Manufacturing Process?&quot; It seems portions of matter could serve as inputs to many more processes than just manufacturing processes.

4. Why is this asserted directly under material entity? As we proceed in adding additional kinds of portions of solids, liquids and gases found in manufacturing we will create many sibling classes under material entity and that, I believe, will cloud the purpose of the BFO foundational classes. Alternative approaches: (a) Assert a grouping class under material entity, say a &quot;portion of material,” and put the various portions of xyz beneath it. Or (b) put all portions of xyz under object. After all, a rock, a portion of water, and even portions of gas and sub-atomic particles, all fit nicely under object. But then we come up with arguments on how they satisfy the causal unity criterion (see Barry&apos;s arguments for &quot;rock&quot; in the BFO 2.0 reference document). In offline discussions, Barry&apos;s recommendation is option (b), perhaps also with a grouping-level term such as &quot;portion of material.&quot;

5. Whether we introduce a &quot;portion of material&quot; class and leave it as a subclass of material entity, or move it under object, don&apos;t we need to add yet another class, &quot;portion of processed material,&quot; under &quot;material artifact?&quot; We can wait to do this for the day we see the need surface in domain working group use cases, but thinking ahead, maybe we already introduce a place-holder for this now.

        <skos:example>1. On a somewhat higher level of complexity are what we shall call rate process profiles, which are the targets of selective abstraction focused not on determinate quality magnitudes plotted over time, but rather on certain ratios between these magnitudes and elapsed times. A speed process profile, for example, is represented by a graph plotting against time the ratio of distance covered per unit of time. Since rates may change, and since such changes, too, may have rates of change, we have to deal here with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive levels

2. One important sub-family of rate process profiles is illustrated by the beat or frequency profiles of cyclical processes, illustrated by the 60 beats per minute beating process of John’s heart, or the 120 beats per minute drumming process involved in one of John’s performances in a rock band, and so on. Each such process includes what we shall call a beat process profile instance as part, a subtype of rate process profile in which the salient ratio is not distance covered but rather number of beat cycles per unit of time. Each beat process profile instance instantiates the determinable universal beat process profile. But it also instantiates multiple more specialized universals at lower levels of generality, selected from   rate process profilebeat process profileregular beat process profile3 bpm beat process profile4 bpm beat process profileirregular beat process profileincreasing beat process profileand so on.In the case of a regular beat process profile, a rate can be assigned in the simplest possible fashion by dividing the number of cycles by the length of the temporal region occupied by the beating process profile as a whole. Irregular process profiles of this sort, for example as identified in the clinic, or in the readings on an aircraft instrument panel, are often of diagnostic significance.

3. The simplest type of process profiles are what we shall call ‘quality process profiles’, which are the process profiles which serve as the foci of the sort of selective abstraction that is involved when measurements are made of changes in single qualities, as illustrated, for example, by process profiles of mass, temperature, aortic pressure, and so on.</skos:example>

Designs go beyond an entity&apos;s qualities.
 
(c) Unless the design has done a good job of tracing product requirements to features and components of a design, it is not inherently apparent whether or how a design satisfies such requirements. Requirements traceability is a separate ICE used to map and trace requirements to features in a product design, and is distinct from a design. 

Action Items: 
1. Need to analyze and create terms for several other key related entities such as the As-Designed/As-Engineered BOM.

2. Need to expand in our analysis on how designs are related to evolving product requirements in the middle and later stages of new product introduction, or design changes to existing product lines, or design changes on existing products that are already in production.

3. As mentioned under term Requirement, and Specification, we need to do a more complete job analyzing the related entities and life cycle in the various stages of the product life cycle (requirements soliciation &amp; specification, design, implementation, etc.)</xUnresolvedIssues>

The argument on why introduced this more narrow definition of the concept is to differentiate between those processes that produce a Manufactured Product from those that produce other non-manufactured products.</xUnresolvedIssues>
        <rdfs:comment>1. A product production process is distinct from a maintenance process in that, in the latter case, the product exists both before and after the process occurs.

2. A product production process has several planned processes as parts (sub-processes), including at least one manufacturing or assembly process, and  optionally, may include other planned process types such as inspection, packaging, rework, and material-handling.  

3. Note that the various parts of a product production process, for example, inspection, testing, cannot be a product production process by themselves.

4. Some manufacturing processes will also be product production processes.</rdfs:comment>

        <xUnresolvedIssues>1. Do we want to keep &quot;intends to sell&quot; in the definition and as proposed above in the comments? If we keep &quot;intends to sell&quot; in the definition, we need to introduce a relation for this.

2. Concerning the &quot;end of life&quot; of a product, when a continuant is no longer to carry the product role, do we extend the definition to include this eventuality?</xUnresolvedIssues>
        <rdfs:comment>1. The BFO term ‘role’ is used extensively in this formalization to do justice to those cases where general terms are ​phase sortals,​ which means they hold only for certain phases in the existence of the relevant entities. Thus, for example, a given material entity may be correctly describable as a ​prototype at one phase in its existence and as a ​product​ in a later phase.

Although the above holds true for the general use of roles, we choose here to insert &quot;intends to sell&quot; into the definition, allowing us to have an umbrella term that covers all phases a product&apos;s life cycle, including those before it physically exists or is available to be sold. This would suggest we might introduce subclasses such as &quot;product-in-design role,&quot; &quot;prototype product role,&quot; etc., as the ontology evolves.
 
2. Once a continuant bears the product role, it continues to do so for the life of the product -- that is until such time that it is the output of some &quot;end of life&quot; process. 

Note, the end of life process in some cases might be when the Agent who sells ceases to support it. Agent here includes successor Agent-owners. In other cases, the end of life may be when the last instance of a product type is recycled. Example: that pair of shoes AIR MAX 90 ESSENTIAL sneakers sold by Nike bears the role of product throughout its product life cycle, and until Nike stops selling and marketing the style.</rdfs:comment>

        <xUnresolvedIssues>1. This is a net-new term introduced since December based on discussions to provide a general class for all types of resources. In this definition, we wanted to add relation &quot;provides benefit to&quot; or even “realizes a function” as found in the common definitions, but chose not to. One argument against adding is that while a resource may be available to an agent to use or obtain, and may be in actual use or the agent has some planned use for it, there will be other cases where it is not in use nor does the agent have any plans to do so. Example: The gold in my vault is available to me but I have no planned use for it yet.

2. Yet with this new definition, it apperas we might have problems with relation “is available to.” Namely, something available to an agent to do something with that has not yet been determined, opens to door up to how we deal with “possibilities” in FOL and OWL. Perhaps the work-around is to say available-to means an agent has access to or control over some thing, to be potentially used, or has some active intention to use, or is currently using it. 

3. Also, regardless of how we ultmately define this, we have to align the definition with what we have from December for Manufacturing Resource Role.</xUnresolvedIssues>
        <rdfs:comment>It is not a requirement that the something be of value or is in actual or intended use by an Agent, in order for it to bear the resource role.  The value of the something can drastically change without altering whether that thing is a Resource.</rdfs:comment>

        <xUnresolvedIssues>1. Might want to relax the definition a bit to handle counter example #1 -- that is to allow both human tasks and inanimate object tasks. Or, we might introduce inanimate object (smart machines and software) under term Agent. 

2. Might need subclasses of task to differentiate between &quot;human tasks,&quot;work tasks,&quot; &quot;personal tasks&quot; (individual &amp; inter-relationship based), etc.</xUnresolvedIssues>

        <iof-av:naturalLanguageDefinition>A task specification prescribes some action intended to be assigned to and performed by some person or group of persons, that specifies or sets some expecation as to the timeframe in which it is to occur.</iof-av:naturalLanguageDefinition>
        <iof-av:semi-formalNaturalLanguageDefinition>task description =def. an objective specification that prescribes some task that is intended to be concretized by a specific person or group of persons, and which specifies some starting or ending timeframe in which the task is to occur.</iof-av:semi-formalNaturalLanguageDefinition>
        <xDefinitionOtherCommon>See definitions under term Task.</xDefinitionOtherCommon>
        <rdfs:comment>1. A task description can be created, assigned and detailed electronically in some project or other task management system, verbally communicated, self-assigned and recorded in one&apos;s mobile phone, or post-it note, or kept &quot;in the back of one&apos;s mind.&quot;

2. The term is is asserted under plan specification since one can argue that a task specification also implies (or sets some expectation at a minimum) some objective or outcome to be accomplished.

3. A task may be, but is not required to be, part of a work breakdown structure or action complex.

4. We leave out that a task definition is not broken down further. In decomposing projects, complex tasks are decomposed (involving a work-breakdown structure) until they are &quot;simple enough&quot; to be assignable to a given person or group of persons, in which they are able to be performed and completed in a narrow time frame.</rdfs:comment>

        <iof-av:naturalLanguageDefinition>tool =def. material artifact used by some person, or when added as a part of some machine, enables or improves some function or capability realized in actions of a certain kind.</iof-av:naturalLanguageDefinition>
        <xDefinitionOtherCommon>1. [APICS]: Any instrument, such as a saw blade, that is the working part of a machine.

2. [wikipedia] A tool is an object used to extend the ability of an individual to modify features of the surrounding environment. Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools. The set of tools required to perform different tasks that are part of the same activity is called gear or equipment.

2. [dictionary] A tool is a device or implement, especially one held in the hand, used to carry out a particular function.

3. [From prior IOF Discussions]: 
(a) A piece of equipment used by a machine or as stand-alone and can bear a Manufacturing Role.
(b) Are tools always movable? We believe the answer is a yes but invite our wider IOF audience to cite use cases where this is not the case.
(c) Other attributes:
- Some tools are consumed others are not. 
- Some are used by people, others by machines.
- Some tools are &quot;single-item&quot; or stand-alone (e.g., hammer) and others may be complex (e.g., Wi-Fi-connected digital torque wrench).
- Aren&apos;t fixtures tools as well? Yes, they are a subtype. See definition below for IOF Fixture, a top-20 term
- Most if not all tools have various interfaces (electronic, mechanical, etc.)</xDefinitionOtherCommon>
        <xUnresolvedIssues>1. Made some major revisions to align more with standard definitions. Will formalize if approved.

2. We might want to introduce various subclasses: Mechanical tools, hand tools, powered/machine-based hand tools, cutting tools (linear, rotary, hybrid), instrument, machine tools, etc.

3. Might want to introduce tool role and make this a defined class.</xUnresolvedIssues>

        <xExampleComplement>A specific type of material handling: E.g., changing only the orientation of the object within the same site (this does not change the site from t to t’).</xExampleComplement>
        <xExampleCounter>throwing waste into a garbage bin; removing a wing nut from a fixture in preparation for inserting a workpiece into the fixture.</xExampleCounter>
        <xUnresolvedIssues>1. Eventually we may need to look into FMA ontology and how they handled orientations. Is change in orientation to be considered under this definition?

2. I think we should change the label to something else, perhaps &quot;material handling process&quot; or &quot;material movement process.&quot; The classical meaning of the verb &quot;to transport&quot; means &quot;to take or carry (people or goods) from one place to another by means of a vehicle, aircraft, or ship.&quot; Also, this term is too similar to the classical use of the terms to transport and of various transportation processes as used in the logistics industry. 

3. For the formal definition we have arrived at above, any process where you change the site of a material entity, would be a transport process -- even the picking up of a tool from the site of a tool box as part of the process of setting up a part in a fixture will be inferred as a transport process.</xUnresolvedIssues>
        <rdfs:comment>Transport process includes both the internal (e.g., inside a factory) and external (e.g., between factories) movement of an object</rdfs:comment>
