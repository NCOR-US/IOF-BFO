        <cco:definition>Containment is location not involving parthood, and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved.</cco:definition>
        <cco:definition xml:lang="en">Containment obtains in each case between material and immaterial continuants, for instance: lung contained_in thoracic cavity; bladder contained_in pelvic cavity. Hence containment is not a transitive relation.    If c part_of c1 at t then we have also, by our definition and by the axioms of mereology applied to spatial regions, c located_in c1 at t. Thus, many examples of instance-level location relations for continuants are in fact cases of instance-level parthood. For material continuants location and parthood coincide. Containment is location not involving parthood, and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved. To understand this relation, we first define overlap for continuants as follows:    c1 overlap c2 at t =def for some c, c part_of c1 at t and c part_of c2 at t. The containment relation on the instance level can then be defined (see definition):</cco:definition>

        <cco:definition xml:lang="en">Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1.    Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus</cco:definition>

        <rdfs:comment>1. Prescribes is a primitive relation. A prescribes B means: A is some information content entity that tells us how the world has to be for it to conform to A. For example, a command prescribes how you should behave in order to conform to the command. A quality specification prescribes how a product has to be in order to conform to the quality specification.

2. Prescribes can be understood in terms of Searle’s idea of a mind to world direction of fit – where prescribing occurs there is a portion of reality that involves something like an attempt by an agent to make the world fit what the agent intends. World to mind direction of fit occurs where a mind tries to make itself fit – for example, in its assertions or beliefs – the world [19].</rdfs:comment>

        <example_counter>A car, a machine, a respirator. Although these can be disassembled, they are not components since they are not consumed by or go into any parent assembly or system, and hence are not assemblies.</example_counter>
        <unresolved_issues>1. This updated definition tries to address many of the issues raised last year (see master working document of IOF terms). Major changes: moved term under material artifact. Dropped class/subclass subassembly and completed assembly. Aligned definition to model it after the one found in businessdictionary.com (see above).

2. As a general unresolved issue (for this and many other terms), need to figure out how to represent various modal forms of these entities in the core ontology (i.e., unfinished assembly, disassembled assembly. Also, we need a way to represent work-in-progress or WIP material entities and artifacts. Some of these are not yet components (as they don&apos;t show up on some bill of material), while others are (phantom component). 

3. Related terms to be created:

disassembly capability =def. a capability, that if realized, is realized in some act of disassembly

act of disassembly =def. planned process prescribed by some plan specification (disassembly instructions) wherein an input assembly containing one or more components as parts is taken apart to create outputs: the assembly and one ore more components as separated material artifacts, and which realizes some disassembly capability of the assembly and components.

Obviously need to formalize what it means to not damage a material artifact/entity, and to not destroy one.</unresolved_issues>

Axiom: Capabilities are such that their realizations can be graded on a scale according to some normative range, which if realized within the normative range, will have satisfied “an interest” of some organism.

More general than function, but not the &quot;reason&quot; for the bearer&apos;s exist.
Turn functions into capabilities (the capability of drill bit gives its host, drilling press, the function to do drilling activities).

        <source xml:lang="en">Barry/external discussions with other ontology efforts</source>
        <unresolved_issues xml:lang="en">1. The term “organism” needs to be introduced or we might replace it with “intentional agent.” We can grab a suitable definition from CCO or OBI for organism, but the latter term has not been defined yet. Organism might have subclasses “Person,” and “Animal” (non-exhaustive).

2. Relation “has an interest in” needs to be introduced. Our prior definition had “provides benefit to some agent.” 

3. We might soon be introducing subclasses of capability such as “biological capability,” “designed/engineered capability,” “skill” and perhaps “learned capability” (for non-human agents/entities). How quickly we introduce these into the IOF core depends on WG use cases and shared notions surfacing from them.</unresolved_issues>

        <rdfs:comment>1. The BFO term ‘disposition’ is used to refer to all tendencies, powers, habits, skills, potentials, and so forth, which a material entity may possess. Dispositions, like BFO:realizables, are realized in processes.

2. This definition does not attempt to capture “task-based” capabilities an entity may bear -- e.g., a stone’s capability to kill when used by some person. Rather, it captures “proper capabilities.” See related discussion of “proper functions” in the literature. 

3. Some but not all functions are capabilities. Capabilities are often added to an artifact by the designer/engineer, or to a biological entity by evolution or nature, as “additional benefits,” and are differentiated from function or purpose. E.g. the air conditioner in your car is a capability but not the function of your car. The ability of your heart to beat fast to support your need to run fast to escape a threat.”

4. An organism’s interest in the capability of an entity may be direct, indirect, or it may even be unaware of any interest/benefit. E.g., this titanium drill-bit’s capability to mill/drill hardened materials may be of direct interest to some process designer searching for a suitable tool to do material removal, yet of fairly indirect interest to the tool bit’s original designer.  The leadership skills of an organization’s management may be of direct interest to the executive team, yet of little interest to a rank-and-file staff member. Furthermore, an organism may benefit from an entity’s capability without even being aware of it. E.g., rank-and-file staff members may not care or know about the benefits he/she derives from the leadership skills of his manager.</rdfs:comment>

(a) replaced material artifact with &quot;material entity that is not an agent,&quot; since portions of material substances and subsystems can be components too. Moved defined class Component under material entity as well.

(b) All components appear in some bill of material (maintenance BOM, product BOM, engineering BOM, planning BOM, manufacturing BOM, packaging BOM) at some level below the root. If we accept this new definition, we will have to introduce term BOM.

(c) We could leave Neil&apos;s notion in the ontology as a super-class of the above, and and rename the new term/subclass to &quot;manufacturing component role.&quot;

4. A component can be a raw material -- as in appear at the lowest level of some BOM. (Don&apos;t forget to update definition of raw material to reflect this once adding in BOM.)

5. Do we need to restrict the scope of material entity to exclude agent and various types of object aggregates? 

6. In batch and continuous process industries, portions of materials are mixed together to create compound materials, or react to create portions of some new material, that are sold as manufactured product or be semi-processed materials consumed in downstream processes. These are all considered component materials or portions of some component material. We may need to further relax the above definition to say that the thing the component becomes a part of, is a material entity. But this starts to conflict with parthood rules. TBD</unresolved_issues>

        <rdfs:comment>1. If the agent of an intention is an organization (for example a business entity, a department, a team), then the organizational agent&apos;s intention will be the collective plans (some of which may be shared &amp; others not or at the individual level) of the corresponding person or members of the organization realizing the intention. Where persons of different levels of authority are involved, the subplans will be correspondingly nested. ​FIND LITERATURE ON THIS.

        <unresolved_issues>1. Notice the changes from Neil&apos;s original definition: &quot;manufacturing enterprise =def. business entity whose function is to engage in manufacturing enterprise processes.&quot; 

Main arguments for the changes are: (a) We want more alignment to the SME definition (i.e., it is a business entity established to produce goods for sale -- as in manufactured products). (b) We want to be explicit about &apos;engaging in&apos; some manufacturing process, versus just &apos;participating in&apos; it, since otherwise we have counter examples where resellers, transportation and logitics companies, distributors, and other 3rd-party agents, that only &apos;participate in&apos; the production process, will be inferred as manufacturing enterprises. And (c) we needed to eliminate the circularity Neil had introduced in term Manufacturing Enterprise Process, which is defined as &quot;a process that has agent, some manufacturing enterprise.&quot;

        <definition-NL>Manufacturing Enterprise Process =def. a Business Process that achieves some Objective and where the Objective is carried by a Business Entity, some Manufacturing Enterprise.</definition-NL>
        <unresolved_issues>1. Made a few changes to the definition from what was previously proposed. Many agents, not necessarily those who are members of the manufacturing enterprise, may be playing a causal role in executing the processes of a manufacturing enterprise. E.g., the maintenance worker employeed by an outsourced maintenance service company who is on-premise fixing a broken machine belonging to the manufacturing enterprise. We can&apos;t really limit all agents to the manufacturing enterprise or members of it. What we can assert is that a manufacturing enterprise process achieves some objective that is &quot;carried&quot; (in BFO lingo) by the manufacturing entity. 

But how do we bound the scope of this? There are many processes performed by 3rd-party agents (logistics providers, suppliers, etc.), that while they directly achieve some objective carried by the enterprise with whom they have a contract, such agent types engage in many subprocesses of such dealing with logistics providers and down-stream suppliers, where there is no clear connection to how these other activities achieve contract terms they may have with some Manufacturing Enterprise (customer). 

2. Also, I&apos;m not convinced this class belongs under the process branch of BFO. An enterprise process has parts any number of subprocesses which can be further decomposed into subprocesses to n levels. It is always the case that many of these are happing in parrallel (i.e., overlap on temporal regions) which would violate proper parthood rules for processes. Perhaps we move this class under Process Aggregate? Or, if we can leave it under Process, make it a defined class with no asserted subclasses, and just let the reasoners make the inferences as necessary.

A similar argument we will have when introducing product lifecycle process (or process aggregate).</unresolved_issues>
        <rdfs:comment>A manufacturing enterprise process includes as parts many planned processes  that achieve some objective of the manufacturing enterprise. The agents participating in these planned processes are typically members of the enterprise (permanent and temporary employees) but may also inlcude contractors and 3rd-parties working or operating under some agreement with the enterprise. Such planned processes include all the activities needed to run the enterprise, for example not just manufacturing processes, but support processes happening in the executive office, the &quot;back-offices&quot; and the front-offices, as well as enterprise resource planning, product design and engineering, manufacturing engineering, and the other &quot;manufacturing operations management&quot; support processes happening within the four walls of the factory.</rdfs:comment>

[APICS]</definition_other_common>
        <unresolved_issues>1. The label is quite polysemous and means different things in different domains. Renamed the term to manufacturing operation.

2. The above definition has been generalized from what we had in December (&quot;planned process that is part of a product production process and is prescribed by an operation specification) to reflect more closely what this notion means in manufactuirng operations (see other common definitions above). Changes include:

(a) Generalized to allow operations to have any number of subclasses in sub-domains (maintenance operation, assembly operation, material handling operation, receiving operation, etc.)

(b) Removed restriction that an operation must be part of a product production process. If we need a subclass to capture the type of operations that only &quot;consume&quot; or &quot;modify&quot; input materials to produce semi-finished material entities or manufactured products as output, then we can do so. Or better yet, the PPS working group can do so in their ontology module.

(c) Added restriction that requires participation of some Resource via the &quot;realizes some resource role&quot; clause. 

(d) Added restriction that an operation must occur in a single spatial region.

(e) Planned processes (inspection, test, material change, material modification, material move, etc.) can be realized as part of a manufaturing process, or in other contexts, hence, we make manufacturing operation a defined class, under which any of these can be inferred, when they are part of a manufacturing process.

3. We should probably introduce term location and replace site.

4. Need to introduce new planned processes &quot;material change process&quot; and &quot;material modification process.&quot;</unresolved_issues>

2. Manual sawing operation: A specification to cut off part of a workpiece. In this case, the worker is using a handheld power saw to accomplish the operation. 

3. Testing. Although testing does not usually consume or modify a workpiece or portion of output material (unless it is an act of destructive testing or some act of drawing a sample to be consumed in a test), it does have as participant the manufactured product, or any input material is intended to or already is a part of the manufactured product.  

4. Setup or teardown of a machine in before/after the actual machining operation.
 
5. Moving a workpiece to the location or site where an operation is to take place. Moving a raw material or component item from stock to staging locations on the shop floor.

6. The disassembly or repair (other types of planned processes) of a manufactured product, or a component intended to be part of one, may or may not be inferred as a manufacturing operation depending on whether an instance of it appears as part of some manufacturing process. On the other hand, an instance of the same assembly, disasembly, or repair operation (e.g., of my Dell laptop at home by an authorized repair agent of Dell&apos;s), would likely be need to be inferred as part of an on-site repair process, or of a planned maintenance work order for some machine that a customer buys and has placed into service in their factory.</cco:example_of_usage>

        <unresolved_issues>We agreed in our 18-Feb-2020 meeting to remove functional subclasses of Resource from the IOF core ontology, and let the various working group create functional defined classes of resource, if they wish, for their domains. We propose to move this term to the PPS ontology and have that working group decide. Manufacturing Resource was a top-20 term and surfaces all the time in manufacturing process design, enterprise resource planning and manufacturing operations management contexts.</unresolved_issues>

In this revised definition, we relabel this term to &quot;manufacturing operation specification, and restrict it to prescribing a manufacturing operation.

Now if the intent was to capture some of the other aspects from ISO&apos;s definition, then perhaps we can open the debate again on the notion of feature vs quality in general, or between distinquishing features and other features, or between qualities that are inherent vs assigned, or those that are qualitative or quantitative, or those that are sensory vs behavioral, vs temporal, vs ergonomic;-)</unresolved_issues>

More generally, any action where the causitive agent intends to adhere to laws and rules, may be improperly inferred as planned processes.</example_counter>
        <unresolved_issues xml:lang="en">1. We probably should figure out a way to formalize the definition so it includes the three complement scenarios above, (a), (b) and (c). Realizing a process that (a) is not prescribed by some plan specification but rather mentally derived by a causative agent of type person, or verbally communicated and agreed to in the case of a person-aggregate type agent. , or (b) has a prescribed plan specification lacking sufficient details, or (c) is a process that has sub-processes, one or more of which lack a plan specification, or lack sufficient detail.  Such processes might still be considered planned processes -- meaning planned processes that perhaps are lacking in &quot;process maturity&quot; -- which often result in a wide degree of variability in achieving the desired outcomes. In many such processes, the causitive agent must rely on his/her/its experience, knowledge of best practices, etc., to form individual or collective intentions that are applied in realizing a process to the best of their abilities.

Part of this will be dependent on what definition we settle on for term plan specification. If we extend that definition to include ‘protocol-driven&apos; plans, which include spoken or simply thought plans. In this case, complement scenario (a) above will be automatically included. If we proceed in this fasion, we should add a more general term above Plan Specification, perhaps &quot;Plan,&quot; that has subclasses plan specification, verbally-communicated plan, and mental plan.

3. Do we need to expand our notion of Agent? Right now, all planned processes involve some Agent as participant, and our notion of agent is limited to person or organization. Yet many planned processes require no agent to be present (as in a lights-out factory, production line, totally-automated assembly cell, or the use of smart/autonomous machine).

4. Also, Agent as currently defined, excludes person aggregates. This needs to be resolved since teams or crews may need to collectively bear a resource role in order to realize their dispositions in planned processes. And teams/person aggregates are not organizations.</unresolved_issues>

        <rdfs:comment>1. This definition implies that every planned process is an action (though not vice versa). 
				  
2. &apos;Planned’ is here functioning as a specifier, rather than as a modifier analogous to ‘cancelled’ or ‘averted’. Therefore, to say that an action is planned is not to say that it has not yet taken place; rather, it is to say that it is (was or will have been) protocol-driven, instruction-driven, command-driven, or software-driven, or in some combination thereof, as prescribed by one or more information content entities. 
				  
3. A planned process remains a planned process even after it has occurred. Hence, the contrast is with accidental processes or with processes that did not turn out as planned (for example because a drill bit broke while realizing a planned drilling process), or with incidental processes not part of the realization of a plan (such as the lathe operator smoking a cigarette while operating her lathe).
				  
4. ‘Planned’ means ‘protocol driven’. Protocols may be written, spoken, or simply thought – as when upon waking up, we plan, for instance, what to eat for breakfast.</rdfs:comment>

        <unresolved_issues>1. We&apos;ve previously added the counter examples above but I don&apos;t believe they are valid since none of them are inputs to a manufacturing process. Rather, they participate in manufacturing processes via the usedIn or are AgentIn relations.

2. Aren&apos;t the inputs to a manufacturing process specified in some directive ICE, as in e.g., a process specification, the work instructions, a BOM (picklist), etc.? To be discussed.

3. Why is portion of input material not asserted under Object Aggregate? I believe the answer is lack of causal unity (see BFO 2.0 reference document).

4. If we are to introduce a class like this, why not then introduce simply &quot;Input Material (defined class) =def. Material Entity and bears Input Material Role?&quot; This will be come useful in definiing Manufacturing Process (see its definition).</unresolved_issues>

        <cco:example_of_usage>1. On a somewhat higher level of complexity are what we shall call rate process profiles, which are the targets of selective abstraction focused not on determinate quality magnitudes plotted over time, but rather on certain ratios between these magnitudes and elapsed times. A speed process profile, for example, is represented by a graph plotting against time the ratio of distance covered per unit of time. Since rates may change, and since such changes, too, may have rates of change, we have to deal here with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive levels

2. One important sub-family of rate process profiles is illustrated by the beat or frequency profiles of cyclical processes, illustrated by the 60 beats per minute beating process of John’s heart, or the 120 beats per minute drumming process involved in one of John’s performances in a rock band, and so on. Each such process includes what we shall call a beat process profile instance as part, a subtype of rate process profile in which the salient ratio is not distance covered but rather number of beat cycles per unit of time. Each beat process profile instance instantiates the determinable universal beat process profile. But it also instantiates multiple more specialized universals at lower levels of generality, selected from   rate process profilebeat process profileregular beat process profile3 bpm beat process profile4 bpm beat process profileirregular beat process profileincreasing beat process profileand so on.In the case of a regular beat process profile, a rate can be assigned in the simplest possible fashion by dividing the number of cycles by the length of the temporal region occupied by the beating process profile as a whole. Irregular process profiles of this sort, for example as identified in the clinic, or in the readings on an aircraft instrument panel, are often of diagnostic significance.

3. The simplest type of process profiles are what we shall call ‘quality process profiles’, which are the process profiles which serve as the foci of the sort of selective abstraction that is involved when measurements are made of changes in single qualities, as illustrated, for example, by process profiles of mass, temperature, aortic pressure, and so on.</cco:example_of_usage>

        <unresolved_issues>Proposed changes reflected above:
(a) Renamed it to Product Design.

(b) Deleted &quot;...and its qualities...&quot; from the previous definition since the range of relation &apos;prescribes&apos; covers both how continuants must exist and how occurents must unfold spatiotemporally, in order for it to conform to the design. Designs go beyond an entity&apos;s qualities.
 
(c) Unless the design has done a good job of tracing product requirements to features and components of a design, it is not inherently apparent whether or how a design satisfies such requirements. Requirements traceability is a separate ICE used to map and trace requirements to features in a product design, and is distinct from a design. 

Action Items: 
1. Need to analyze and create terms for several other key related entities such as the As-Designed/As-Engineered BOM.

2. Need to expand in our analysis on how designs are related to evolving product requirements in the middle and later stages of new product introduction, or design changes to existing product lines, or design changes on existing products that are already in production.

3. As mentioned under term Requirement, and Specification, we need to do a more complete job analyzing the related entities and life cycle in the various stages of the product life cycle (requirements soliciation &amp; specification, design, implementation, etc.)</unresolved_issues>

        <definition-NL>A role a continuant has because some agent intends to sell it.</definition-NL>
        <definition-NL>Open action items:
1. Do we want to keep &quot;intends to sell&quot; in the definition and as proposed above in the comments? If we keep &quot;intends to sell&quot; in the definition, we need to introduce a relation for this.
3. Concerning the &quot;end of life&quot; of a product, when a continuant is no longer to carry the product role, do we extend the definition to include this eventuality?</definition-NL>
        <rdfs:comment>1. The BFO term ‘role’ is used extensively in this formalization to do justice to those cases where general terms are ​phase sortals,​ which means they hold only for certain phases in the existence of the relevant entities. Thus, for example, a given material entity may be correctly describable as a ​prototype at one phase in its existence and as a ​product​ in a later phase.

Although the above holds true for the general use of roles, we choose here to insert &quot;intends to sell&quot; into the definition, allowing us to have an umbrella term that covers all phases a product&apos;s life cycle, including those before it physically exists or is available to be sold. This would suggest we might introduce subclasses such as &quot;product-in-design role,&quot; &quot;prototype product role,&quot; etc., as the ontology evolves.
 
2. Once a continuant bears the product role, it continues to do so for the life of the product -- that is until such time that it is the output of some &quot;end of life&quot; process. 

Note, the end of life process in some cases might be when the Agent who sells ceases to support it. Agent here includes successor Agent-owners. In other cases, the end of life may be when the last instance of a product type is recycled. Example: that pair of shoes AIR MAX 90 ESSENTIAL sneakers sold by Nike bears the role of product throughout its product life cycle, and until Nike stops selling and marketing the style.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>1. This class is designed to group continuants according to a very broad criterion and is not intended to be used as a parent class for entities that can be more specifically represented under another class. Hence, Natural Resource may be an appropriate subtype but Money, Oil, and Gold Mine are not.

2. This term is intended to serve as a super-class to more specific resource types found in the industry-specific domains. E.g., the notion behind the term &quot;manufacturing resource,&quot; appearing often in the process planning and enterprise resource planning domains, may not be present, or may have a different meaning in various other industrial domains. Future evolution of the IOF core ontology may well promote such resource types to the core if broad applicability and a common definition is observed across the sub-domains.</rdfs:comment>

        <source xml:lang="en">Adapted from Artifact Ontology</source>
        <unresolved_issues>1. This is a net-new term introduced since December based on discussions to provide a general class for all types of resources. In this definition, we wanted to add relation &quot;provides benefit to&quot; or even “realizes a function” as found in the common definitions, but chose not to. One argument against adding is that while a resource may be available to an agent to use or obtain, and may be in actual use or the agent has some planned use for it, there will be other cases where it is not in use nor does the agent have any plans to do so. Example: The gold in my vault is available to me but I have no planned use for it yet.

2. Yet with this new definition, it apperas we might have problems with relation “is available to.” Namely, something available to an agent to do something with that has not yet been determined, opens to door up to how we deal with “possibilities” in FOL and OWL. Perhaps the work-around is to say available-to means an agent has access to or control over some thing, to be potentially used, or has some active intention to use, or is currently using it. 

3. Also, regardless of how we ultmately define this, we have to align the definition with what we have from December for Manufacturing Resource Role.</unresolved_issues>
        <rdfs:comment>It is not a requirement that the something be of value or is in actual or intended use by an Agent, in order for it to bear the resource role.  The value of the something can drastically change without altering whether that thing is a Resource.</rdfs:comment>

        <definition_other_common>1. From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_project_management]:
(a) Task is part of a set of actions which accomplish a job, problem or assignment.
(b) [A task] in project management [is an] activity that needs to be accomplished within a defined period of time.
(c) [defined period of time] is a narrow field of time, or a particular point in time, by which an objective or task must be accomplished.
(d) [A task can be part of] a chronological sequence of events, also referred to as a chronology, schedule or timetable.

2. [BPMN/OMG.org]: A task represents a single unit of work that is not or cannot be broken down to a further level of business process detail. It is referred to as an atomic activity. A task is the lowest level activity illustrated on a process diagram. A set of tasks may represent a high-level procedure.

3. [APICS]: (a) In project management, the lowest level to which work can be subdivided on a project. (b) In activity-based cost accounting, a task, a subdivision of an activity, is the least amount of work. Tasks are used to describe activities.

4. [International Warehouse &amp; Logistics Association]: The breakdown of the work in an activity into smaller elements, each element being a task.

5. [dictionary]: A piece of work to be done or undertaken.</definition_other_common>
        <example_counter>1. Robot performing a single task (e.g. of positioning a car door on a car chassis) in a highly automated automotive final assembly line. The decomposition of complex processes into smaller subprocesses, sometimes into &quot;atomic&quot; sub processes within some context -- robot programming in this case -- are often called tasks. 

2. A quarterly update meeting scheduled by the human resources to all employees inviting them to the CEO&apos;s quarterly update talk, and appearing on each employee&apos;s calendar.

3. An email the CEO flags for follow-up and for which she enters some due date. 

4. A yellow sticky note the CEO leaves on her secretary&apos;s desk to follow up on something.

5. The verbal instructions the CEO gives her children concerning what to eat on her way to work.</example_counter>
        <unresolved_issues>1. Might want to relax the definition a bit to handle counter example #1 -- that is to allow both human tasks and inanimate object tasks. Or, we might introduce inanimate object (smart machines and software) under term Agent. 

2. Might need subclasses of task to differentiate between &quot;human tasks,&quot;work tasks,&quot; &quot;personal tasks&quot; (individual &amp; inter-relationship based), etc.</unresolved_issues>

        <definition_other_common>See definitions under term Task.</definition_other_common>
        <rdfs:comment>1. A task description can be created, assigned and detailed electronically in some project or other task management system, verbally communicated, self-assigned and recorded in one&apos;s mobile phone, or post-it note, or kept &quot;in the back of one&apos;s mind.&quot;

2. The term is is asserted under plan specification since one can argue that a task specification also implies (or sets some expectation at a minimum) some objective or outcome to be accomplished.

3. A task may be, but is not required to be, part of a work breakdown structure or action complex.

4. We leave out that a task definition is not broken down further. In decomposing projects, complex tasks are decomposed (involving a work-breakdown structure) until they are &quot;simple enough&quot; to be assignable to a given person or group of persons, in which they are able to be performed and completed in a narrow time frame.</rdfs:comment>

        <definition_other_common>1. [APICS]: Any instrument, such as a saw blade, that is the working part of a machine.

2. [wikipedia] A tool is an object used to extend the ability of an individual to modify features of the surrounding environment. Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools. The set of tools required to perform different tasks that are part of the same activity is called gear or equipment.

2. [dictionary] A tool is a device or implement, especially one held in the hand, used to carry out a particular function.

3. [From prior IOF Discussions]: 
(a) A piece of equipment used by a machine or as stand-alone and can bear a Manufacturing Role.
(b) Are tools always movable? We believe the answer is a yes but invite our wider IOF audience to cite use cases where this is not the case.
(c) Other attributes:
- Some tools are consumed others are not. 
- Some are used by people, others by machines.
- Some tools are &quot;single-item&quot; or stand-alone (e.g., hammer) and others may be complex (e.g., Wi-Fi-connected digital torque wrench).
- Aren&apos;t fixtures tools as well? Yes, they are a subtype. See definition below for IOF Fixture, a top-20 term
- Most if not all tools have various interfaces (electronic, mechanical, etc.)</definition_other_common>

        <unresolved_issues>1. Eventually we may need to look into FMA ontology and how they handled orientations. Is change in orientation to be considered under this definition?

2. I think we should change the label to something else, perhaps &quot;material handling process&quot; or &quot;material movement process.&quot; The classical meaning of the verb &quot;to transport&quot; means &quot;to take or carry (people or goods) from one place to another by means of a vehicle, aircraft, or ship.&quot; Also, this term is too similar to the classical use of the terms to transport and of various transportation processes as used in the logistics industry. 

3. For the formal definition we have arrived at above, any process where you change the site of a material entity, would be a transport process -- even the picking up of a tool from the site of a tool box as part of the process of setting up a part in a fixture will be inferred as a transport process.</unresolved_issues>

        <rdfs:comment>Information Content Entity is here intended to be a class of Entities whose instances are the informational content of Information Bearing Entities. For example, three instances of information bearers -- such as a bar chart, color-coded map, and a written report -- each of which lists the GDP of Countries for the year 2010 are each different bearers of the same information content. It is this content that is generically dependent upon its bearer. This treatment of Informational Content Entity (cf. the Information Artifact Ontology) leads to a principle of subtyping based upon the relationship that ICE&apos;s have with the Entity they are about rather than characteristics such as format, language, measurement scale, or media. The latter are treated here as being Qualities of bearers.</rdfs:comment>

        <cco:definition>A Process Aggregate that consists of the sum of all Processes that are part of or otherwise involved in the primary Process (i.e., the Process for which the history is being represented) and which are bounded by the Spatiotemporal Region in which the primary Process occurs.</cco:definition>
        <cco:elucidation>While a History is, roughly, the sum of all Processes involving a particular Independent Continuant, a Process History is, roughly, the sum of all Processes involved with a particular Process, which often includes other Processes that the Agents and Participants in the primary Process are participating in during the same Temporal Region.</cco:elucidation>
        <cco:example_of_usage>The Process History of a particular passenger flight includes the processes of refueling, takeoff, landing, passenger and luggage loading and unloading, flight attendants serving refreshments and peanuts, passengers sitting, pilots operating the flight controls, air rushing past the plane, communications with air traffic control, sensor operations, and many more.</cco:example_of_usage>
